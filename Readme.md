# Screen upside down
A script rotating the screen of an unlocked computer.

## Description
This script does not use powershell of cmd to execute but goes directly to the desired settings.
The script targets Windows 10 and 11. There are some things you can or need to adjust to your target.
These are:
1. Variable $D to change the delay time between every action
2. The delay time after typing in `display`
3. Variable $A to adjust the amount of `TAB` pressed

## Getting started
Adjust the above settings to your liking and upload the `inject.bin` on your Rubber Ducky.

And it is GO-TIME!

Have fun and keep on pranking!
